#### _Author: Qiushuang/Rachel Xu_


**Motivation**: The COVID-19 pandemic brought numerous multi-faceted challenges to the world. In an attempt to evaluate the current situation of California around two years after the onset of the pandemic, this project was carried out with the hope to shed some light on the question.

**Data**: The datasets used in the project were gathered from various sources (CDC, California Data Portal, etc). Some were directly downloaded while others were obtained through API requests. Links to these data and more details can be found under [/data](https://github.com/rachxu/141B-proj/tree/main/data) directory. 

**Notebook**: The majority of the coding done in this project was implemented with Jupyter notebook. The notebook file used to obtain the PDF that was submitted to gradescope can be found under [/notebook](https://github.com/rachxu/141B-proj/tree/main/notebook) directory.
